# Traverse Wikipeida
A simple tool for building relational graphs of arbitrary Wikipedia pages. Page x is related to page y if page x has link y in its text. I use the Wikimedia API to get this information.

## Future features
-Create massive database with preprocessed page traversion.<br>
-Add NLP relationships (find relationship in link sentence)<br>
-Make graph more customizable (change depth, max child nodes, colors...)<br>
-More interactive map and able to search page from map node
-Better resolve if link is redirect
